Question 1: What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? 
Explain with examples. 
Arithmetic operators 
Assignment operators 
Comparison operators 
Logical operators 

Answer:
1. Arithmetic Operators  
These are used to perform mathematical calculations.
Example:
let a = 10, b = 5;
console.log(a + b); // Addition: 15
console.log(a - b); // Subtraction: 5
console.log(a * b); // Multiplication: 50
console.log(a / b); // Division: 2
console.log(a % b); // Modulus: 0

2. Assignment Operators  
These are used to assign values to variables.
Example:
let x = 10;      // Assigns 10 to x
x += 5;          // Adds 5 to x (x = x + 5)
x *= 2;          // Multiplies x by 2 (x = x * 2)

3. Comparison Operators  
These are used to compare two values and return true or false.
Example:
console.log(a > b);   // true
console.log(a < b);   // false
console.log(a == b);  // false
console.log(a != b);  // true

4. Logical Operators  
These are used to combine multiple conditions.
Example:
let age = 20;
console.log(age > 18 && age < 30); // true (AND)
console.log(age < 18 || age > 30); // false (OR)
console.log(!(age < 18));          // true (NOT)
       
Question 2: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? 
 
Answer:
The `==` operator checks for equality after converting both values to a common type (type coercion).  
The `===` operator checks for equality without type conversion; both value and type must be the same.

Example:
console.log(5 == "5");   // true (values are equal after type conversion)
console.log(5 === "5");  // false (types are different: number vs string)
