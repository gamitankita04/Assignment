Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript? 
Explain how if-else statements work withan example.

Answer:
        Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which statements and instructions are executed in a program. It allows you to make decisions, repeat actions, and control which code runs based on certain conditions.

        If-else statements are used to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

        Example:
        let num = 7;
        if (num > 5) {
            console.log("The number is greater than 5.");
        } else {
            console.log("The number is 5 or less.");
        }

Question 2: Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a 
switch statement instead of if-else?

Answer:
        A switch statement in JavaScript is used to perform different actions based on 
        different values of a variable or expression. It compares the value to multiple 
        case labels and executes the matching case block. If no case matches, 
        the default block runs.

        Syntax:
        switch(expression) {
            case value1:
                // code block
                break;
            case value2:
                // code block
                break;
            default:
                // code block
        }

        You should use a switch statement instead of if-else when you need to compare the 
        same variable or expression against many possible values. Switch statements make 
        the code easier to read and manage when there are multiple
