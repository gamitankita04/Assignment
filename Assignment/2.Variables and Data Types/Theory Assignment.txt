Question 1: What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using 
var, let,and const? 

Answer: 
       Variables in JavaScript:

        Variables are containers that store values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using:

        1. Var:
            - var variableName = value;
            - Function scope
            - Can be redeclared and updated

        2. Let:
            - let variableName = value;
            - Block scope
            - Can be updated, but not redeclared

        3. Const:
            - const variableName = value;
            - Block scope
            - Cannot be updated or redeclared

        Example:

        var x = 10;
        let y = 20;
        const PI = 3.14;

        x = 30; // valid
        y = 40; // valid
        // PI = 50; // invalid

       
Question 2: Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for 
each. 

Answer:
       JavaScript Data Types:

            JavaScript has several data types, including:

            Primitive Data Types
            1. Number:
                - Represents numeric values.
                - Example: `let age = 25;`

            2. String:
                - Represents text.
                - Example: `let name = "John";`

            3. Boolean:
                - Represents true or false values.
                - Example: `let isAdmin = true;`

            4. Null:
                - Represents the absence of any value.
                - Example: `let empty = null;`

            5. Undefined:
                - Represents an uninitialized variable.
                - Example: `let notAssigned;`

            6. Symbol:
                - Represents a unique symbol.
                - Example: `let sym = Symbol("foo");`

            7. BigInt:
                - Represents large integers.
                - Example: `let bigInt = 12345678901234567890n;`

            Complex Data Types
            1. Object:
                - Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
                - Example: `let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };`

            2. Array:
                - Represents a collection of values.
                - Example: `let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];`

            These data types are the building blocks of JavaScript programming.

Question 3: What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript? 

Answer:
        Undefined vs. Null in JavaScript:

        1. Undefined:
            - Represents a variable that has been declared but not initialized.
            - Example: `let x; console.log(x); // undefined`

        2. Null:
            - Represents the intentional absence of any value.
            - Example: `let y = null; console.log(y); // null`

        Key differences:

        1. Intent: `undefined` is often a result of a variable being declared but not assigned a value, while `null` is an explicit assignment to represent the absence of a value.
        2. Type: `undefined` is a type itself, while `null` is an object type.

        In summary, `undefined` typically indicates a lack of initialization, while `null` indicates an intentional absence of value.
