Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript 
(for, while, do-while). Provide abasic example of each. 

Answer:
        In JavaScript, there are three main types of loops:

        1. for loop  
        The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

        Example:
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }

        2. while loop  
        The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition. The loop runs as long as the condition is true.

        Example:
        let i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }

        3. do-while loop  
        The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.

        Example:
        let i = 0;
        do {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        } while (i < 5);
    
Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop? 

Answer:
        The main difference is when the condition is checked:

        - In a while loop, the condition is checked **before** the code block runs. If the condition is false at the start, the loop body may not execute at all.
        - In a do-while loop, the code block runs **at least once** before the condition is checked, because the condition is evaluated after the code block.

        Example:

        // while loop
        let i = 10;
        while (i < 5) {
            console.log(i); // This will not run because the condition is false
            i++;
        }

        // do-while loop
        let j = 10;
        do {
            console.log(j); // This will run once even though the condition is false
            j++;
        } while (j < 5);
